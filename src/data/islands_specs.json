      "In 1578, on the return journey of Sir Martin Frobisher’s third attempt to find a Northwest Passage from Europe to Asia through the Arctic, his crew makes an unexpected discovery: their smallest ship is separated during a heavy storm from the rest of the expedition. Making their way homeward they discover an island: <i>never yet founde before, and sayled three days alongst the coast, the land seeming to be fruitful, full of woods, and a champion countrie</i>. Soon after, the Buss appears on sea charts. Many navigators attempt to find Buss, some of them reporting great banks of ice (rather than fruits and trees) until in 1671 the royal hydrographer John Seller draws a detailed map of the island. Seller labels its harbours, capes and bays with names he derives from those of several directors of the newly formed Hudson’s Bay Company. In May 1675, the Company acquires the rights of trade and commerce for this island that no one has ever set foot on. By the 18th century, with maritime traffic increasing in the North Atlantic and no further sightings recorded, Buss is treated with suspicion: whether it was a real island that sank, or an erroneously cartographed bank of fog, or a fraud from the very beginning – in 1791 Captain Charles Duncan, hired by the HBC to locate the land of Buss, gives up: <i> I strove as much as the winds would permit me to keep in the supposed latitude of the supposed Buss island, but it is my firm opinion that no such island is now above water, if ever it was</i>.",

      "Named after the Irish saint who claims to have landed there in 512 with at least a dozen other monks. The monastic party reported its stay as 15 days, while the ships that expected their return complained that they had to wait a year, during which period the island remained concealed behind a thick curtain of mist. St. Brendan’s discovery is mentioned in several medieval texts and stokes the interest of the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460), who orders an expedition to the island after hearing reports of its sighting. In 1719, the Scottish monk Sigbert de Gembloux reports seeing the island, as does Don Matea Dacesta, mayor of Valverde, on the Canary island of El Hierro in 1721. According to the Canary historian Ramirez, in 1723 a priest performs the rite of exorcism towards the island during one of its apparitions behind low cloud. And in 1759 an unnamed Franciscan monk writes of an occasion when the island was visible for 90 minutes and was witnessed by about 40 spectators.",

It is a good place for fresh water and tinder. Its harbour is excellent with safe anchorage for a thousand ships. We saw an enormous number of birds on this island and we believe that there will be abundant fishing around its coasts, for they are surrounded by a bottom of sand and shingle.</i> The editor and publisher of Cowley’s journal, William Hacke names this island Pepys after the then secretary of the British Admiralty, Samuel Pepys. Hacke also omits a crucial reference made by Cowley: <i>We saw likewise another island by this that night, which made me thinke them to be the Sebald de Weerts</i> (as the Falkland Islands are called at this time). At least 111 maps and 130 years of searches later, it becomes clear that Pepys must be a misidentified account of the Falkland Islands. Ironically, in a journal entry written on the same ship and later published in <i>A New Voyage Round the World</i> (1697), William Dampier clearly states sighting one of the Falklands on this date.",

This far south, the familiar constellations of the north disappear beyond the horizon, and in the middle of a storm he sights a new land. Sailing alongside for almost 20 leagues, Vespucci describes the coast as wild, without any harbour or people and does not attempt to land there. The island remains lost for 250 years until the Spanish trade ship <i>Aurora</i> identifies three islands at the same location in 1762. These islands, now called the Auroras, are sighted several times again in the 18th and 19th century, and deliver the basis for the plot of Edgar Allan Poe’s <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket </i>(1838).",

In 1765 an unidentified buccaneer reports going ashore and killing a dozen oxen in less than two hours and in 1772 a further sighting is made from a ship passing from the Cape of Good Hope to the Isle of France (Mauritius). In 1806, French authorities, eager to expand their operations in the western Indian Ocean, launch an investigation into the alleged establishment and evacuation of a Portuguese settlement on Juan de Lisboa.",

Hunter and some of the men go to meet Funafooah, the king of the island, and present him and his brother with white shirts. Seemingly delighted, they offer gifts in return: a hog, a basket of yams, bananas and cocoa-nuts. The women of the island have red, circular tattoos inscribed their arms, wear shells as ornaments and have some kind of white paste smeared on top of their hair. Captain Hunter also observes that all islanders have their cheekbones perforated and their little fingers cut off at the second joint on the left hand – a peculiarity of self-mutilation that later on arouses the interest of numerous anthropologists. Numerous attempts to are made to locate Onaseuse in the 19th century but it is never seen again. ",

      "Captain Dougherty of the <i>James Stewart</i>, an English whaler, discovers the island in 1841 and describes it as 5–6 miles long with a high bluff to the northeast and a valley in the middle covered in snow. Dougherty's discovery is confirmed by Captain Keates of the <i>Louise</i> in 1859, and by Captain Stannard of the <i>Thurso</i> in 1891. Sailing through the area during Shackleton's Antarctic expedition of 1908–1909, Captain Davis, Chief Officer of the <i>Nimrod</i> suggests that Dougherty, Keates, and Stannard have all been deceived by fog banks or icebergs. A license granting “exclusive rights to occupy the island for the purposes of removing guano and other fertilising substances” is issued to the Norwegian whaler HJ Bull by the British Government in 1913.",

      "As described in William Dampier’s book <i>A New Voyage Round the World</i>, Edward Davis, one of a number of pirates operating off the Pacific coast of America at this time, discovers the island in 1687 while in command of the ship <i>Bachelor’s Delight</i>. The Dutch West India Company dispatches three ships to the area in 1721 under the command of Jacob Roggeveen. Though unable to find Davis Land, Roggeveen and his crew stumble upon the previously unknown Easter Island. Their visit results in the death of about a dozen islanders and the wounding of many others.",
