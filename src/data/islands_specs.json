      "Frisland is first mentioned in a letter purportedly written around 1390 by the Venetian navigator Nicholas Zeno, who describes being blown off course on his way to England and being stranded on an inhabited island south of Iceland. The letter is found by Zeno’s descendent Nico, a historian and cartographer, who publishes a book and map depicting Frisland and its surroundings in 1558. Thereafter, it is repeatedly sighted, and reproduced on maps – including Mercator’s and Ortelius’ – for well over a century. In 1580, Frisland is claimed for the English crown by Queen Elizabeth’s advisor John Dee. It remains unclear whether Frisland is a deliberate fabrication, a case of mistaken identity (Frisland actually being Iceland, the Shetlands or Faroe Islands), or evidence in favor of a Venetian claim of having reached North America before Columbus.",

      "In 1578, on the return journey of Sir Martin Frobisher’s third attempt to find a Northwest Passage to Asia through the Arctic, the smallest ship of the flotilla is separated from the rest of the expedition during a heavy storm. On its way homeward, its crew sees an island <i>never yet founde before, and sayled three days alongst the coast, the land seeming to be fruitful, full of woods, and a champion countrie</i>. Soon after, the island Buss appears on sea charts. Many navigators attempt to find it, some of them reporting great banks of ice (rather than fruits and trees) until in 1671 the royal hydrographer John Seller draws a detailed map of the island. Seller labels its harbours, capes and bays with names he derives from the directors of the newly formed Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). In May 1675, the HBC acquires the rights of trade and commerce for this island no one has ever set foot on. By the 18th century, with maritime traffic increasing in the North Atlantic and no further sightings recorded, Buss is treated with suspicion. Whether it was a real island that sank, or an erroneously cartographed bank of fog, or a fraud from the very beginning, in 1791 Captain Charles Duncan, hired by the HBC to locate the land of Buss, gives up: <i> I strove as much as the winds would permit me to keep in the supposed latitude of the supposed Buss island, but it is my firm opinion that no such island is now above water, if ever it was</i>.",

They report their stay as 15 days, while the ships that expect their return complain that they had to wait a year, during which period the island remained concealed behind a thick curtain of mist. St. Brendan’s discovery is mentioned in several medieval texts and stokes the interest of the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460), who orders an expedition to the island. In 1719, the Scottish monk Sigbert de Gembloux reports seeing the island, as does Don Matea Dacesta, mayor of Valverde, on the Canary island of El Hierro in 1721. According to the Canary historian Ramirez, in 1723 a priest performs the rite of exorcism towards the island during one of its apparitions behind low cloud. And in 1759 an unnamed Franciscan monk writes of an occasion when the island was visible for 90 minutes and was witnessed by about 40 spectators.",

It is a good place for fresh water and tinder. Its harbour is excellent with safe anchorage for a thousand ships. We saw an enormous number of birds on this island and we believe that there will be abundant fishing around its coasts, for they are surrounded by a bottom of sand and shingle.</i> The editor and publisher of Cowley’s journal, William Hacke names this island Pepys after the then secretary of the British Admiralty, Samuel Pepys. Hacke also omits a crucial reference made by Cowley: <i>We saw likewise another island by this that night, which made me thinke them to be the Sebald de Weerts</i> (as the Falkland Islands are called at this time). At least 111 maps and 130 years of searches later, it becomes clear that Pepys must be a misidentified account of the Falkland Islands. Ironically, in a journal entry written on the same ship and later published in <i>A New Voyage Round the World</i> (1697), William Dampier clearly states sighting one of the Falklands on this date.",

This far below the equator, the familiar constellations of the north disappear beyond the horizon, and in the middle of a storm a new land is sighted. Sailing alongside for almost 20 leagues, Vespucci describes the coast as wild, without any harbour or people and does not attempt to land there. The island remains lost for 250 years until the Spanish trade ship <i>Aurora</i> identifies three islands at the same location in 1762. These islands, now called the Auroras, are sighted several times again in the 18th and 19th century, and deliver the basis for the plot of Edgar Allan Poe’s <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket </i>(1838).",

      "In 1622 on the newly established shipping route from Holland around the Cape of Good Hope to Dutch possessions in the East Indies, the <i>Tryal</i> wrecks on rocks off the coast of western Australia. A search and sighting of the rocks is made by a sloop sent in 1718 from the Dutch East Indies capital of Batavia (present day Jakarta) but numerous subsequent Dutch and English expeditions turn up nothing and the Rocks’ existence is cast into doubt. In 1818, the British brig <i>Greyhound</i>, captained by Lieutenant Ritchie, encounters the true Tryal Rocks. They are not recognised as such, however, as the Tryal Rocks are thought to be much further west and, by this time, to have never existed in the first place. Ritchie's discovery is entered on maps as Ritchie's Reef. Then in 1934, after an examination of a letter sent by a survivor of the <i>Tryal</i> shipwreck and a survey of the area, Ritchie’s Reef is declared to definitely be Tryal Rocks. Final confirmation comes in 1969, when explosives used in an illegal salvage attempt badly damages the wreck of the sunken <i>Tryal</i>.",

They are met by a group of natives bringing them meat and plantains for refreshment. Hunter and some of the men go to meet Funafooah, the king of the island, and present him and his brother with white shirts. Seemingly delighted, they offer gifts in return: a hog, a basket of yams, bananas and cocoa-nuts. The women of the island have red, circular tattoos inscribed their arms, wear shells as ornaments and have some kind of white paste smeared on top of their hair. Captain Hunter also observes that all islanders have their cheekbones perforated and their little fingers cut off at the second joint on the left hand – a peculiarity of self-mutilation that later on arouses the interest of numerous anthropologists. Several attempts to are made to locate Onaseuse in the 19th century but it is never seen again. ",

On their return journey to Mexico, one of these ships also reports visiting Los Jardines. Further sightings and reports of their existence continue sporadically into the 19th century.

In 1997, as the United States and Mexico prepare to negotiate a treaty on sovereignty over international waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the Mexican government sends a survey vessel to scan the area where Bermeja might have been in the hope of being able to lay claim to the surrounding waters – the search turns up nothing. Six members of the Mexican senate voice their suspicions that the island may have been destroyed by the US Central Intelligence Agency to ensure US hegemony over the offshore oil and gas fields. Shortly after demanding further investigation into the possibility of Bermeja’s existence and warning of a secret plan by the government to give up exploration rights to US companies, one of the senators is driven off the road and killed by an assailant who is never caught.

Captain Fred Stein and marine geologist Maria Seton have ordered their crew on deck to scan the waves for dangerous riffs or seabed sightings. Some of the scientists on board follow the search on the computer screen – and are amused to live-track their ship as it crosses the black pixels on Google Maps labelled Sandy Island. The explorers have <i>undiscovered</i> an islet that has been on the maps since Captain Cook charted it on his second voyage as lying off the northern tip of New Caledonia. A British Admiralty chart of 1908 that includes Sandy Island warns: <i>Caution is necessary while navigating among the low lying islands of the Pacific Ocean.
