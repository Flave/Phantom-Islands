The descriptions of these islands, purporting to be original logbook entries made on the respective journeys, were however Morrell's inventions. Despite never being sighted by any other party, the islands remained on oceanographic charts well into the 20th century, and even caused the International Date Line to be redrawn in order put Morrell's Island into the same time zone as Hawaii.",
