## How to edit island specs

To make adjustments to the individual island sounds you'll have to make edits to the file `data/islands_specs.json`. This is a file formatted in the [JSON](http://json.org/) data structure so to make it work it will have to be formatted properly.

This specific file contains a list (delimited by `[` and `]` brackets) of island objects (delimited by `{´ and ´}` brackets). Each island contains a series of properties. The following describes briefly what each property does.

| Property Name | Required | Default (if not specified) | Description |
| :------------ | :------- | :------------------------- | :---------- |
| name          | True |                  |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
|               |                            |             |
